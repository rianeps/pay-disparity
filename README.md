# Pay Disparity — visualizing gender pay gaps through scrollytelling


A small learning project built to practice D3.js, scrollytelling with Scrollama, and to improve how I design and present data visualizations. The site explores gender pay differences over time and across occupations through interactive charts and narrative steps.

Why this project
- Learn D3 patterns: joins, scales, axes, transitions, and small-multiples layout
- Practice scrollytelling: synchronize text-driven narrative with visualization changes
- Improve visual communication: clarity, annotation, accessible color choices, and showing uncertainty/sample sizes
