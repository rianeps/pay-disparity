# Pay Disparity
### Visualizing gender pay gaps through scrollytelling


I built this project to level up my coding skills and move beyond basic, static charts. I am using D3.js to create dynamic, animated SVG visualizations that are more engaging than standard graphs. This project is a way to implement scrollytelling by using Scrollama to trigger visual updates as a user moves through the page. Because I am interested in data journalism, I am exploring how web apps can take complex structural issues like the gender pay gap and make them easier to visualize and understand.

Why this project
- Learn D3 patterns: joins, scales, axes, transitions, and small-multiples layout
- Practice scrollytelling: synchronize text-driven narrative with visualization changes
- Improve visual communication: clarity, annotation, accessible color choices, and showing uncertainty/sample sizes
